Description: This is a toolbox to deal with uncertainty with analyses performed with NONMEM. Contains functions to parse information about the form of blocks in a `$OMEGA` or `$SIGMA` matrix, to isolate variance-covariance matrices from a NONMEM output, to compute degrees of freedom, and to automatically write the code that is inserted when the `$PRIOR NWPRI` routine is used.
